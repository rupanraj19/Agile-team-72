                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Mental health is a crucial aspect of our overall well-being, and understanding various mental health disorders helps in providing support and reducing stigma. Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, often leading to a disconnect from reality.</p>

                    <h2>What is Schizophrenia?</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by episodes of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, which significantly impact daily functioning.</p>

                    <h3>Key Symptoms:</h3>

                        <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> Seeing or hearing things that are not present, such as hearing voices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delusions:</strong> Strongly held false beliefs, such as believing one has special powers or is being persecuted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disorganized Thinking:</strong> Incoherent or nonsensical speech, difficulty organizing thoughts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Negative Symptoms:</strong> Reduced emotional expression, lack of motivation, social withdrawal, and neglect of personal hygiene.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cognitive Symptoms:</strong> Impaired memory, attention, and executive functioning (e.g., decision-making).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> A family history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders increases the risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Biological Factors:</strong> Imbalances in brain chemistry, particularly dopamine and glutamate, play a key role.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Prenatal exposure to stress, malnutrition, or infections, as well as early-life trauma, may contribute to the development of schizophrenia.</li>
                        <li><strong>Psychosocial Factors:</strong> Chronic stress, substance abuse, and social isolation can exacerbate symptoms or trigger episodes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
                    <p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on a thorough psychiatric evaluation, medical history, and the presence of key symptoms for at least six months, with significant functional impairment.</p>

                    <h3>Treatment Options:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment to manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), supportive therapy, and psychoeducation help patients manage symptoms and improve social skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Rehabilitation:</strong> Programs aimed at improving social and occupational functioning, including supported employment and community support services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lifestyle Management:</strong> Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and avoiding substance abuse are crucial for managing symptoms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Family Support:</strong> Involvement of family in treatment through family therapy and support groups can provide essential support for both patients and caregivers.</li>
